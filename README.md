## Introduction

Customer churn is a critical concern for businesses across various industries. Predicting which customers are more likely to leave can help companies take proactive measures to retain them. This machine learning project aims to build a predictive model using customer data to identify potential churn cases. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Churn_Modelling.csv** file. It contains various features related to customers, including their credit scores, demographics, account information, and activity status. The target variable is "Exited," indicating whether a customer has churned (1) or not (0).

## Usage

1. Upload the dataset Churn_Modelling.csv into the project directory.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script in your preferred development environment.
3. Run the code cells to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and model training.
4. The trained model's performance will be evaluated using accuracy and the confusion matrix metrics.

## Results

The project provides insights into customer churn prediction through various stages of data processing and analysis. The key steps include:

1. Loading and exploring the dataset
2. Preprocessing and converting categorical variables
3. Visualizing correlations between features
4. Training a Random Forest Classifier model
5. Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy and the confusion matrix

The results can guide businesses in understanding customer behaviors that contribute to churn and improving customer retention strategies.
